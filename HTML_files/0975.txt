<p>Hugo W. Koehler was born on July 19, 1886, in <a href="/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, and named after a paternal uncle. His father, Oscar C. Koehler (1857â1902), was a first-generation German-American and second-generation St. Louis and <a href="/wiki/Davenport,_Iowa" title="Davenport, Iowa">Davenport, Iowa</a> <a href="/wiki/Brewer" class="mw-redirect" title="Brewer">brewer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneur" class="mw-redirect" title="Entrepreneur">entrepreneur</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Although it was privately rumored for much of his life that Hugo was the illegitimate son of <a href="/wiki/Rudolf,_Crown_Prince_of_Austria" title="Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria">Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria</a>, who is generally believed to have died with his teenage mistress, <a href="/wiki/Baroness_Mary_Vetsera" title="Baroness Mary Vetsera">Baroness Mary Vetsera</a>, in a <a href="/wiki/Murder-suicide" class="mw-redirect" title="Murder-suicide">murder-suicide</a> pact in January 1889 (the "<a href="/wiki/Mayerling_incident" title="Mayerling incident">Mayerling incident</a>"), no corroborating evidence of this ancestry has been established.  The speculation was fueled by a few factors: 1) Koehler, who was reputed to be the "wealthiest officer" in the American navy in the 1920s, was apparently the beneficiary of a substantial <a href="/wiki/Trust_fund" class="mw-redirect" title="Trust fund">trust fund</a>.

</p><p>Ironically, in 1945, <i>The New York Times</i> published a story that a German lithographer by the name of "Hugo Koehler", following his death at the age of 93, was revealed to be <a href="/wiki/Archduke_Johann_Salvator_of_Austria" title="Archduke Johann Salvator of Austria">Archduke Johann Salvator of Austria</a>, son of <a href="/wiki/Leopold_II,_Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany" title="Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany">Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany</a> and a member of the Imperial Austrian Habsburg family. Johann had been a witness to the tragic events at <a href="/wiki/Mayerling" title="Mayerling">Mayerling</a> in 1889.  Rudolf, unsatisfied in his marriage to <a href="/wiki/Princess_St%C3%A9phanie_of_Belgium" title="Princess StÃ©phanie of Belgium">Stephanie</a>, daughter of <a href="/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium" title="Leopold II of Belgium">Leopold II of Belgium</a> had found romance with Mary, the younger daughter of a Hungarian earl.  Taking her along on a party to his hunting lodge at Mayerling, the young woman soon became excessively animated and sought to interject herself into court politics and intrigue.  Rudolf snubbed her for this, and in a fit of rage, the 17-year old baroness smashed a bottle of champagne over Rudolf's head, killing him.  Hearing the fracas and then a gunshot, Johann and other revelers on a nearby balcony, rushed into the salon to discover that Rudolf's valet had avenged his master's death with a single, fatal gunshot to Mary Vetsera.  The event was immediately <a href="/wiki/Cover-up" title="Cover-up">covered-up</a>, and the story of a murder-suicide was fabricated.  Enemies of both Rudolf and Johann, began spreading innuendo that Johann was implicated in Rudolf's death.  When <a href="/wiki/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria" title="Franz Joseph I of Austria">Emperor Franz Joseph</a> questioned the young <a href="/wiki/Archduke" title="Archduke">archduke</a> about these rumors in 1889, Johan became furious and broke his sword over his knee. Tearing the <a href="/wiki/Epaulets" class="mw-redirect" title="Epaulets">epaulets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Military_awards_and_decorations" title="Military awards and decorations">decorations</a> off his uniform, Johann threw them at the feet of the emperor, and renounced his right to the throne until such time as he might be cleared of the false accusations.  The Emperor, indignant at Johan's actions, sentenced him to lose his princely rights and succession for twenty years.  Johan then left the country and assumed his new life and the name "John Orth".  Orth and his wife, an actress, were believed lost at sea in a shipwreck off <a href="/wiki/Cape_Horn" title="Cape Horn">Cape Horn</a> in 1890 and were declared dead <a href="/wiki/In_absentia" title="In absentia">in absentia</a> in 1911.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The 1945 story of Johan's (Orth's) survival has not been established as true.

<p>Koehler's grandfather, Heinrich, was born in the state of <a href="/wiki/Hesse" title="Hesse">Hesse</a> in Germany. A master-brewer trained at <a href="/wiki/Mainz" title="Mainz">Mainz</a>, he had immigrated to America at the age of twenty-one, quickly making his way to St. Louis, where German-Americans accounted for nearly one-third the population of 78,000 in 1850.  Working his way up to <a href="/wiki/Shop_foreman" title="Shop foreman">foreman</a> at the Lemp brewery, by 1851 Koehler had saved enough <a href="/wiki/Financial_capital" title="Financial capital">capital</a> to start his own <a href="/wiki/Brewery" title="Brewery">brewery</a>, and moved 225 miles upriver on the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi</a> to <a href="/wiki/Fort_Madison,_Iowa" title="Fort Madison, Iowa">Fort Madison, Iowa</a>, where he purchased a small, but established brewery and introduced <a href="/wiki/Lager_beer" class="mw-redirect" title="Lager beer">lager beer</a> to the surrounding area.  Around 1863, Heinrich, who now went by "Henry", leased his brewery to his father-in-law, and moved back to St. Louis where he bought a partnership interest in the Excelsior Brewery from his younger brother, Casper (1835â1910).  By then the city's population had swelled to more than 300,000 and the brothers aimed to increase beer production and sell to the thousands of Federal troops stationed in the city environs.  While the brewery flourished, the brothers' relationship did not.  In 1871, Henry sold his interest to Casper and moved his family upriver to <a href="/wiki/Davenport,_Iowa" title="Davenport, Iowa">Davenport, Iowa</a>.  Davenport was then part of the <a href="/wiki/Quad_Cities" title="Quad Cities">Tri-cities</a> metropolitan area, including the neighboring riverfront cities of <a href="/wiki/Moline,_Illinois" title="Moline, Illinois">Moline</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rock_Island,_Illinois" title="Rock Island, Illinois">Rock Island, Illinois</a>.  A year later, he bought the established Arsenal Brewery with his brother-in-law, Rudolph Lange.  The business was also known as Koehler and Lange, after its owners.  With a growing, largely Germanic <a href="/wiki/Immigrant" class="mw-redirect" title="Immigrant">immigrant</a> population that regarded beer as a <a href="/wiki/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple</a>, Davenport had cheaper <a href="/wiki/Operating_costs" class="mw-redirect" title="Operating costs">operating costs</a> than St. Louis, including river and rail transportation with caves along the river where the beer could be stored.

After completing studies at the Academy of Brewing in <a href="/wiki/Worms,_Germany" title="Worms, Germany">Worms</a>, he entered the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Leipzig" class="mw-redirect" title="University of Leipzig">University of Leipzig</a> where he obtained a <a href="/wiki/Doctorate" title="Doctorate">doctorate</a> in <a href="/wiki/Chemistry" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> four years later.  Returning to America, he was exceptionally trained for the brewing industry. After a brief stint at his father's brewery in Davenport, Oscar moved to St. Louis where he became secretary of the Henry Koehler Brewing Assoc., a business his father established in 1880. The following year, Oscar was joined by his younger brother, Henry Jr. (1863â1912), and by 1883 the business was sold to the St. Louis Brewing Assoc.  As that business was winding down, the Koehler brothers were setting up their successor business, "The Sect Wine Company", which Oscar and his father had started preparing for in 1880 on a stock offering of $135,000 ($3.4 mil. in 2010). With the stated purpose "to deal in nothing but strictly pure wines, recognizing that he who appreciates a fair article will willingly pay a fair price to obtain it", the business occupied a two-story distillery and winery of 80,000 square feet at 2814-24 South Seventh Street in St. Louis.

The Koehler's expansion into the winemaking business, particularly the popular "Koehler's Sect", enhanced both their wealth and prestige in the St. Louis business community.  Their marriages and social activities further solidified their elite standing.  In 1885, Oscar married Mathilda Lange (1866â1947), daughter of William Lange, president of the National Bank of St. Louis.  In 1888, two years after his marriage to Mathilda, Oscar joined the Germania Club, an exclusive club open only to St. Louis residents who had graduated from German universities. Oscar was one of only sixty-one members.<sup id="cite_ref-Oscar_C._Koehler_&#124;_Immigrant_Entrepreneurship_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oscar_C._Koehler_|_Immigrant_Entrepreneurship-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In 1897, Henry Jr. married the California actress Margaret Craven in a San Francisco society wedding that was publicized in the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" class="mw-redirect" title="New York Times">New York</a> and <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a>, the former writing that Craven had married "Henry Koehler, a rich brewer of St. Louis"<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> and the latter reporting that "Miss Craven is a professional actress and is noted for her beauty.

In 1887, they were joined by their younger brother, Hugo (1868â1939), who had originally moved to the city to attend <a href="/wiki/St._Louis_Medical_College" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Louis Medical College">St. Louis Medical College</a>.  In January 1890, the brothers began their most successful venture in the series of business ventures that ultimately amassed them millions of dollars, when they organized the American Brewing Company (A.B.C.) with $300,000 ($7.42 million in 2010) in capital.  Constructed on the site of the Sect Wine Company and other Koehler businesses on South Seventh Street in St. Louis, the huge plant was praised for its architectural design and function, employing the latest in brewing technology including the largest copper brew kettles ever made. As with their champagne and wines, the Koehler's <a href="/wiki/Mission_statement" title="Mission statement">mission statement</a> was "to produce beers of the highest class only, and to obtain patronage by furnishing only such an article."  Before long, the Koehlers' beer, particularly their A.B.C.

In 1894, Oscar left the American Brewing Company and St. Louis, to move back to Davenport, where he took over his father's interest in the Arsenal Brewery (Koehler and Lange).  The change was prompted by Henry's decision to take an extended trip to Europe, where he stayed for two years. In 1895, Oscar commissioned the architect <a href="/wiki/Frederick_G._Clausen" title="Frederick G.

The oldest of six children (Elise (1887-1971), Herbert (1888-1945), Otillie (1894- 1975), Eda (1900-1958), and Hildegarde (1901-1926)), his childhood memories were of preferential treatment over his brother and sisters. Never being disciplined and having the best pony and cart, engendered the notion in Hugo that he was "different".  A prankster in his youth, he delighted in trying the limits of his grandfather's patience. A wine collector, Henry would organize wine-tasting dinners for his friends, who were asked to identify the wine and vintage after trying it.  Once, Hugo decided to substitute inferior wines, believing his grandfather and his friends could not tell the difference. Hiding behind the curtains, Hugo was surprised to see his grandfather's reaction on sampling the wine, as he rose to apologize to his guests that there "must have been some mistake".  When the boy confessed to the deceit later, his grandfather was more hurt than angry. For him, there were certain lines that no gentleman would cross.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Hugo journeyed to <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> with his grandfather, where he was introduced to the <a href="/wiki/Human_physiology" class="mw-redirect" title="Human physiology">human physiologist</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Scott_Haldane" title="John Scott Haldane">John Scott Haldane</a>, statesman-naturalist <a href="/wiki/Edward_Grey,_1st_Viscount_Grey_of_Fallodon" title="Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon">Lord Grey of Fallodon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Empress_Elisabeth_of_Austria" title="Empress Elisabeth of Austria">Empress Elisabeth</a>.

Hugo responded that he would like to be a philosopher, or a <a href="/wiki/Jesuit" class="mw-redirect" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> or a naval officer. His grandfather responded that the boy was already somewhat of a philosopher and observed that for his grandson, the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" class="mw-redirect" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> priesthood would involve "more disadvantages than advantages." He concluded, "if you want to be a naval officer, you will have to get some education first, for the Naval Academy gives you only a training."<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Following the consolidation trend in the brewing industry, in October 1894, Hugo's father, Oscar, merged the Arsenal Brewery with four other breweries into a single firm, Davenport Malting Company, becoming president of the new concern. The <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_scale" class="mw-redirect" title="Economy of scale">economy of scale</a> enabled the firm to bar outside competition that could not compete with the low production costs.  In 1895, the company built a new brewery with modern equipment and expansive storage facilities on the site of the former Lehrkind Brewery on West Second Street. Its <a href="/wiki/Product_line" class="mw-redirect" title="Product line">product line</a> included Davenport Malt Standard (keg beer), Muenchener (both <a href="/wiki/Keg" title="Keg">keg</a> and bottled), and Pale Export (bottled). Strong sales of Pale Export and the Muenchener beers provided the revenue for the addition of a state-of-the-art ice plant in 1896.  In the spring of 1897, the company expanded its plant again, adding a new racking room, wash house, and <a href="/wiki/Hops" title="Hops">hop</a> storage area.  By 1898 sales were so strong that the company increased its <a href="/wiki/Capital_stock" class="mw-redirect" title="Capital stock">capital stock</a> from $50,000 to $150,000 ($1.36 million to $4.07 million in 2010) that provided the funding for a <a href="/wiki/Malt" title="Malt">malt</a> house.  The Davenport Malting Company was the second largest in the state of Iowa, employing sixty men and with fifteen distribution agencies scattered throughout the state. The plant had a capacity of 100,000 barrels, reportedly selling over 50,000 barrels in 1899.  Unfortunately, Oscar Koehler did not live to see the success of the brewery continue into the 20th century, largely due to his effort.  After months of declining health, in 1902 he died at St. Louis, where he had gone for treatment of <a href="/wiki/Bright%27s_Disease" class="mw-redirect" title="Bright&#39;s Disease">Bright's Disease</a>, a form of kidney failure.

<p>Koehler attended <a href="/wiki/Harvard_College" title="Harvard College">Harvard College</a> for his <a href="/wiki/Freshman" title="Freshman">freshman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sophomore" title="Sophomore">sophomore</a> years, before entering the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy" title="United States Naval Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in 1905.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> In the summer between Harvard and Annapolis, Koehler gave a preview of his brazen ability to bluff that would serve him well in war-ravaged Germany and Russia fifteen years later.  Hungry and broke, he and three friends drove to <a href="/wiki/New_York_city" class="mw-redirect" title="New York city">New York city</a> from <a href="/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, after changing three tires along the way. Arriving in the city, Koehler suggested a trip to the theater.  Marching up to the ticket window, he barked, "I say, gimmi mi tickets."  The ticket-man politely asked "What name?" and Koehler gave his last name.  Knowing the ticket-man would not find any tickets under "Koehler" and that the ticket agencies were closed, Koehler fumed, "call Tyson and see about it."  Koehler's ploy worked, and the ticket agent offered them choice tickets that Koehler condescendingly took. Coming out of the theater later and still famished, the group headed up <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Avenue" title="Fifth Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> and bumped into one of Koehler's best friends who staked them for a meal.  "We paid for the tickets the next day, for we thought we might want to work the same game again."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Koehler wrote in a letter shortly after arriving at Annapolis, "Everybody in town, officers, professors, and 'cits', (fellow midshipmen) thinks it most extraordinary that I should go into the Academy ... they say that for a man who has tasted life at Harvard, it is a mighty hard thing to buckle down to the exact routine [and] discipline... in practice here [but] I am going to do my very best here, to make up for my past, and to do something for my future and for the future of the ones I love." What in the eighteen-year old Koehler's past he felt that he had to make up for is unclear.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>  The stories of his arrival at Annapolis vary only in their "outrageousness": that he arrived with a horse and valet; another recounts a horse and cook. While at the Academy, he maintained a <a href="/wiki/Pied_a_terre" class="mw-redirect" title="Pied a terre">pied a terre</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Majordomo" title="Majordomo">steward</a>, where hot food was always available to all comers.  He was known for his success as a <a href="/wiki/Lothario" title="Lothario">ladies' man</a>, often sending <a href="/wiki/Rosa_%27American_Beauty%27" title="Rosa &#39;American Beauty&#39;">American Beauty roses</a> to the objects of his affection.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>  At Annapolis, Koehler qualified as a rifle expert shot in 1908, the highest level, and was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Marksmanship_badges_(United_States)" title="Marksmanship badges (United States)">Navy Sharpshooter's Badge</a>. Somewhat presciently, the page entry for Koehler in the Naval Academy <a href="/wiki/Annual_publication" title="Annual publication">annual</a> <a href="/wiki/Lucky_Bag" title="Lucky Bag">Lucky Bag</a> contains two quotes from Shakespeare that were placed by the editors and intended to capture his <a href="/wiki/Essence" title="Essence">essence</a>, "The glass of fashion and the mold of form, the observed of all observers", and "I am not in the roll of common men." The yearbook editors' words are equally descriptive, "A capable, conceited man who cannot be bluffed."  During the winter before Koehler graduated from Annapolis, his grandfather passed away. Before he died, Henry revealed the purported secret of Hugo's birth.  He told Hugo that his father was not Oscar Koehler, but Rudolph, crown prince of Austria.  There is no record of how Hugo responded to this shocking disclosure. But for the rest of his life, Koehler searched for some proof of this. He revealed the story to only his closest confidants, and speculated that the truth was locked in the archives of the Vatican, that could not be opened for 99-years, until 1987, long after his death.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Under the terms of Oscar Koehler's <a href="/wiki/Will_and_testament" title="Will and testament">will</a>, the Koehler residence on Seventh Street passed to his wife, Mathilda Koehler, with the remainder of the estate held in trust by the executors, who were to invest the money and pay the interest to Mathilda, on a semi-annual basis for the rest of her life. Following her death, the remaining trust was to be divided equally among the children when they came of age.<sup id="cite_ref-Oscar_C._Koehler_&#124;_Immigrant_Entrepreneurship_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oscar_C._Koehler_|_Immigrant_Entrepreneurship-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> This would not explain the mysterious "Austrian trust" with Hugo Koehler as beneficiary, or the inexplicable source of income that gave him the reputation as the "richest officer" in the U.S. Navy. "[K]oehler seemed to possess a beneficent parachute that popped open precisely when he needed it."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Koehler had been taught to speak German and French, along with English.  He spoke British English with a slight German accent, from his <a href="/wiki/Midwest" class="mw-redirect" title="Midwest">Midwest</a> roots. During his four-years at Annapolis, Koehler's performance varied wildly. In May 1908, he ranked 12th in seamanship, 16th in the three separate categories of math, mechanics, and ordinance; 93rd in efficiency; and 161st in marine engines.  He had probably enjoyed the bumps along the road to 215 demerits.  One time, he and his roommate, future rear admiral Ernest Ludolph Gunther (1887â1948) fought so savagely they both ended up in the hospital. Amazingly, the <i>Lucky Bag</i> reported, Gunther "managed to room with Hugo for four years and still maintains his equilibrium of mind." Ultimately, Koehler finished in the exact middle of his class.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>

Wuchang... was entirely in the hands of rebels and there was no possibility of communication with the American residents." Two days later, the log continues, "Midshipman Koehler attended a conference of the consular body at which the Japanese rear admiral Reijiro Kawashima presided, the meeting having been called to consider communications of the rebel commander in chief, in which he stated the aims of the rebel party, and offered to send troops to protect the foreign concessions.  The offer was not accepted... at 1815 sent ashore two Colt automatic guns to American consulate in order to facilitate landing of armed party.... Incendiary fires in Wuchang throughout the night." </p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Rear_Admiral_R._F._Nicholson,_USN_and_Midshipman_Hugo_W._Koehler,_USN_on_excursion,_Kuling_China_1912-14.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Rear_Admiral_R._F._Nicholson%2C_USN_and_Midshipman_Hugo_W._Koehler%2C_USN_on_excursion%2C_Kuling_China_1912-14.jpg/300px-Rear_Admiral_R._F._Nicholson%2C_USN_and_Midshipman_Hugo_W._Koehler%2C_USN_on_excursion%2C_Kuling_China_1912-14.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="174" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Rear_Admiral_R._F._Nicholson%2C_USN_and_Midshipman_Hugo_W._Koehler%2C_USN_on_excursion%2C_Kuling_China_1912-14.jpg/450px-Rear_Admiral_R._F._Nicholson%2C_USN_and_Midshipman_Hugo_W._Koehler%2C_USN_on_excursion%2C_Kuling_China_1912-14.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Rear_Admiral_R._F._Nicholson%2C_USN_and_Midshipman_Hugo_W._Koehler%2C_USN_on_excursion%2C_Kuling_China_1912-14.jpg/600px-Rear_Admiral_R._F._Nicholson%2C_USN_and_Midshipman_Hugo_W._Koehler%2C_USN_on_excursion%2C_Kuling_China_1912-14.jpg 2x" data-file-width="1191" data-file-height="689" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Rear_Admiral_R._F._Nicholson,_USN_and_Midshipman_Hugo_W._Koehler,_USN_on_excursion,_Kuling_China_1912-14.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>R.

Koehler was promoted to ensign on March 28, 1912 to date from June 5, 1911. Koehler was equally at-ease and engaging with the unwashed masses as he was with the aristocracy of his time.  He wrote to his mother about a "wonderful tiger hunting expedition" in Mongolia that he made in November 1912 when he was on leave.

One lieutenant remembered him as "a very <a href="/wiki/Teutons" title="Teutons">Teutonic</a>-looking man and we knew that he went to <a href="/wiki/Sinn_Fein" class="mw-redirect" title="Sinn Fein">Sinn Fein</a> meetings, but just who he pretended to be we never knew."  Mike Vanderbilt, who rented a mansion with Koehler in Queenstown, watched as he "left the table and a few moments later, I saw him sneaking out the front door in civilian clothes, made up to be ever more Germanic than usual."  Sinn FÃ©in meetings were off limits to U.S. personnel.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> Koehler spent considerable energy and time to study "both sides of the Irish question."  He concluded, "But my sympathies are wavering and are now all for the British... But how to satisfy a people split into <a href="/wiki/Political_faction" title="Political faction">factions</a>, each faction demanding something different.... The <a href="/wiki/Home_Rule" class="mw-redirect" title="Home Rule">Home Rule</a> has its stronghold in the South and is solidly <a href="/wiki/Catholic" class="mw-redirect" title="Catholic">Catholic</a>.  The Ulsterites or <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party" title="Ulster Unionist Party">North Irish party</a>, almost as solidly <a href="/wiki/Protestant" class="mw-redirect" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>, are opposed to Home Rule for the simple reason they realize the minute the South Irish party takes charge, all industries of Irelandâabout 95% of which are in the northâwill shortly be taxed out of existence.... I have never yet been able to discover just what the Sinn Feiners want, nor has anybody else.... Taxes here are much less than in England. Irish <a href="/wiki/Per_capita" title="Per capita">per capita</a> representation in Parliament is greater than that of any other country in England.  Food is plentiful.  There are no food restrictions and the English supply them with more food than they give their own people. And yet they have a hymn of hate for the British no less venomous than the German hymn... The great point of difference between the English and the Irish is after all the English have no sense of humor and the Irish have the keenest sense of humor in the world. It is this difference that makes it impossible for Englishmen to understand Irishmen, and it is an <a href="/wiki/Axiom" title="Axiom">axiom</a> that one must first understand those whom one would govern....  One of the most dangerous symptoms lies in the fact that the whole Sinn FÃ©in movement is tinged with the idea of <a href="/wiki/Martyrdom" class="mw-redirect" title="Martyrdom">martyrdom</a>, and it seems to derive considerable strength just from the fact of its hopelessness.  The only parallel I have ever seen was in the Southern Philippines, where native priests told the <a href="/wiki/Moros" title="Moros">Moros</a> that the greatest good that could come of them would be to kill a <a href="/wiki/Pagan" class="mw-redirect" title="Pagan">heathen</a> American and be shot down in turn, for only then would the gods transport them to <a href="/wiki/Seven_Heavens" title="Seven Heavens">Seventh Heaven</a>.  Irishmen are rapidly getting the same sort of <a href="/wiki/Fanaticism" title="Fanaticism">fanaticism</a> and openly declare that they neither fear nor would they regret being shot down for their cause, since every Irishman shot down by the police or soldiery means a distinct gain for Ireland, because 20 men will be inspired by the example of the one who has fallen.... So hurrah for Ireland and the Irish, say I! It's the devil of a country to live in or work in but a fine place to play in. And the Irish? I love them as friends and playmates, but oh! how I'd hate to have them as compatriots or relations."<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Writing to his mother, Koehler described as "murder" the roughness of patrols on the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Sea" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a>, the constant smell of <a href="/wiki/Diesel_fuel" title="Diesel fuel">diesel</a> and twenty-four hours of "drifting patrol", without engines so as to avoid detection by German <a href="/wiki/Submarines" class="mw-redirect" title="Submarines">submarines</a>. The subchasers could determine the direction of a submarine, but not the distance, so they operated in a line of three, each independently determining the direction, with the three lines then plotted on a chart. The point of intersection was the location of the sub, which would have moved on by then, necessitating a new <a href="/wiki/Trilateration" class="mw-redirect" title="Trilateration">trilateration</a> when they reached the last known point, and in that manner "like a hare and hound chase" the subchasers worked in unison with patrol aircraft launched from four airfields on the Irish Coast, that transmitted the location as soon as a <a href="/wiki/Wake" title="Wake">wake</a> or sub was sighted.  "This cooperation of aircraft with subchasers multiplied the usefulness of both, as subchasers became the ears for the aircraft and aircraft became the eyes for the subchasers," Koehler observed.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup>

For instance, Longleat comprises some 68,000 acres.  Of course, that seems a tremendous big corner of a small country like England for one man to own. But no one will ever provide for that land and all the people on it as carefully as have the Thynnes for many generations.  It takes 68,000 acres to support it.  And those aristocrats of England, they deserve well of their country- they've poured out their blood and their treasure unsparingly in this war.  Take the Thynnes, for example. Every one of them did splendidly: The oldest son, Viscount Weymouth (2nd Lt. John Alexander Thynne, 1895â1916), went to France the first week of the war, distinguished himself, and was killed in action a week after he got the <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Cross" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a>.  And the girls saw their job and did it. It was necessary that women, who had never worked before, should go into factories. The quickest way to bring about so revolutionary a change was to make it fashionable. So these girls, with the proudest blood in England in their veins, promptly took jobs in a munition factory.  They stuck at it, and for long hours each day, for month upon month, they worked at their <a href="/wiki/Lathes" class="mw-redirect" title="Lathes">lathes</a> with a thousand other men and girls about them.  In the meantime, their mother, the Marchioness of Bath, converted her home into a hospital and ran it herself, having asked the government for nothing but medicines- she provided doctors and nurses and all else.

With the exception of U-Boat men, the navy and everyone in it is in disgrace. The U-Boat men were loyal throughout the whole revolution, and are loyal to the central government today, but even they appear ashamed of the navy for many of them wear soldier uniforms. Hardly anywhere does anyone see a sailor in uniform.  So thoroughly is the shame of the navy felt that the blue uniform is considered almost a badge of disgrace, and except for the uniforms of men of the few ships still in commission one never sees any blue, although the streets are crowded with men in the forest gray of the infantry."<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup>  At Wilhelmshaven, he put in "a good many hours" reading newspapers, handbills and political pamphlets distributed by the "Workmen's Council", the <a href="/wiki/Socialists" class="mw-redirect" title="Socialists">Socialists</a> and the civil government, with titles such as, "<a href="/wiki/Alfred_von_Tirpitz" title="Alfred von Tirpitz">Tirpitz</a> the Grave Digger of the German Navy".

The crown prince is not popular. They say the Kaiser was badly advised, but that after all, no man in Germany has the interests of Germany so close at heart or worked so hard or tirelessly as did the Kaiser.  Another idea which is also very widespread is that the great <a href="/wiki/General_staff" class="mw-redirect" title="General staff">general staff</a> which he reared so carefully became a car of <a href="/wiki/Juggernaut" title="Juggernaut">Juggernaut</a> and rolled over him.

Food to keep her poor people from suffering and actual starvation within weeks, since they had no money to purchase food at <a href="/wiki/Profiteering_(business)" title="Profiteering (business)">profiteer</a> prices, and to keep her workmen out of <a href="/wiki/Bolshevism" class="mw-redirect" title="Bolshevism">bolshevism</a>.  Raw materials were needed partly for the same reason, to block bolshevism and to help Germany to regain her place in the commercial world and also to repay the enormous war debt saddled on her by the Kaiser and his military advisors. "The Germans are not starved yet, but they are pretty hungry. One sees a good many double chins and paunches still, that is among the men. The women look really emaciated. They have suffered from the food shortage a great deal more than the men. The saddest thing, however; is the suffering among children.  They show it markedly. Infant mortality has been very high and still is, though not as bad as in the winter of 1916â17.  Meat sells at from 29 to 30 marks a pound, including the bone.  To illustrate the scarcity, during an attack of Spartacans in Wilhelmshaven, a horse in a passing cart was shot. Within 20 minutes after it fell, every shred of flesh had been stripped from its bones. This indicates that meat shortage even more plainly than the empty butcher shops do. Grocery shops appear fairly well stocked, but the prices are enormous. Practically everything is rationed, including clothing. Great quantities of potatoes and cabbages are on hand, and, counting the difference in exchange, they can be bought cheaper here than in England.  Practically no vegetables of any other kind are on hand.  No tinned vegetables are obtainable in any of the shops.  Fats do not exist. There is an almost total absence of soap.  They have a substitute which is said to be very poor. The bread is bad.  It is made of wurzel meal, as potatoes cannot be spared for meal. There is very little milk in the country."<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>

"In those questions on which the United States has taken a different stand than the Allies, Germans attribute it to a latent friendship for Germany- a friendship somewhat disturbed these last years but that still exists. It is difficult to point out that the attitude of the U.S. is not that of favoring Germany but simply the earnest desire to do the right thing and bring about a peace that does not contain in the very peace terms the germs of another war.  That the U.S. took none of the surrendered <a href="/wiki/U-boats" class="mw-redirect" title="U-boats">U-boats</a> is well known in Germany and considered a good omen that the U.S. has no desire to take anything from Germany.  Extreme bitterness toward the English seems to be lost in their greater hatred of France.

The city was under <a href="/wiki/Martial_law" title="Martial law">martial law</a> and none of the British officers were interested in going ashore, unlike Koehler and <a href="/wiki/Chief_petty_officer" title="Chief petty officer">Chief</a> <a href="/wiki/Yeoman" title="Yeoman">Yeoman</a> Walter Dring, USN (1894â1984).  Despite warnings of the danger, and armed with a notebook and pencils, Koehler and Dring sauntered down the gangplank and strode to the <a href="/wiki/Hamburg-American_Line" class="mw-redirect" title="Hamburg-American Line">Hamburg-American Line</a> pier.  Pushing through a crowd that was jostling for sugar and cigarettes, the pair were headed towards the main street, when two German military police on a <a href="/wiki/Sidecar" title="Sidecar">sidecar</a> motorcycle stopped and picked them up for questioning. Brought to German naval headquarters, they were interrogated by Admirals <a href="/wiki/Reinhard_Scheer" title="Reinhard Scheer">Scheer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Franz_von_Hipper" title="Franz von Hipper">Von Hipper</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_von_Reuter" title="Ludwig von Reuter">Von Reuter</a>.  Koehler explained that <i>Coventry</i> was the first inspection ship to arrive at Hamburg following the treaty and that the British officers preferred to remain on board.  The Germans were greatly amused that the British were reluctant to come ashore and gave the American naval spy and his <a href="/wiki/Scribe" title="Scribe">scribe</a> permission to travel to Berlin by night train, provided they remained confined to their compartment.  At 7 a.m. the following morning, Koehler and Dring arrived as the first American military to enter Berlin. They flipped a coin to see who would be first off the train, but "both landed on the platform at the same time in a heap".  Koehler hailed a cab, an emaciated horse drawing a cart with bare, iron wheels, and directed the driver to the <a href="/wiki/Adlon_Hotel" class="mw-redirect" title="Adlon Hotel">Adlon Hotel</a>, where he reminisced with the owner, <a href="/wiki/Lorenz_Adlon" title="Lorenz Adlon">Lorenz Adlon</a> (1849â1921) about meeting him in Berlin 25 years earlier with his grandfather, and gave the man two chocolate bars, soap and cigarettes.  After breakfast, the duo's sightseeing was interrupted by three policemen who escorted them back to the hotel.  With no papers other than their orders from London, they were directed to take the 6 o'clock train out of Berlin. But Koehler had other plans, and instead of going back to Hamburg and HMS <i>Coventry</i>, he took Dring to the best hotel in <a href="/wiki/D%C3%BCsseldorf" title="DÃ¼sseldorf">DÃ¼sseldorf</a>.  From there they boarded a train to <a href="/wiki/Hanover" title="Hanover">Hanover</a>, then on to <a href="/wiki/Cologne" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, where Koehler sought out British officers of the <a href="/wiki/British_Army_of_the_Rhine" title="British Army of the Rhine">Army of Occupation</a> who promptly locked them up as spies.  "Hugo looked like the Kaiser with that damn little mustache," complained Dring.  When they were released, they took a train to <a href="/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> and then on to Paris, where Koehler told Dring that he was "going to duck for three or four hours before reporting to the <a href="/wiki/Embassy" class="mw-redirect" title="Embassy">embassy</a>."  Left to face the <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross" class="mw-redirect" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> alone and standing in line for breakfast with other servicemen, Dring was questioned and declared that he had just come from Germany.  Red Cross officials disbelieved his story and the <a href="/wiki/Military_police" title="Military police">MP</a>'s believed he was a spy, so Dring was again arrested and continued to go hungry.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup>

When Dring finally got to the American embassy in Paris, officials asked where Koehler was.  The roving commander showed up a few days later and wrote his follow-up report on conditions inside Germany. On July 7, the adventure was over and Dring was ordered back to London.  Before he left, he introduced Koehler to Rear Admiral <a href="/wiki/Newton_McCully" class="mw-redirect" title="Newton McCully">McCully</a>, who had recently arrived from <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I" title="Allies of World War I">Allied</a> operations in North Russia.

By 1916, fluent in Russian and knowledgeable of the fluid political, military and social conditions there, he warned the State Department that food shortages, official corruption and a demoralized populus might soon force Russia out of World War One. In 1917 he witnessed the beginnings of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution" title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. Shortly after this, he was ordered back to sea duty in the Atlantic and promoted to rear admiral in September 1918. Less than a month before the Armistice, McCully was designated as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in Northern Russia, and read his orders aboard the <a href="/wiki/USS_Olympia_(C-6)" title="USS Olympia (C-6)">USS&#160;<i>Olympia</i></a> on October 24, 1918.

American policy was stated on August 3, 1918, the day after the Allied occupation of Archangel, "Whether from Vladivostok or from Murmansk and Archangel, the only present object for which American troops will be employed will be to guard military stores which may subsequently be needed by Russian forces and to render such aid as may be acceptable to the Russians in the organization of their self-defense."

Repeatedly questioned by a <a href="/wiki/Commisar" class="mw-redirect" title="Commisar">commisar</a> what <a href="/wiki/Triple_Entente" title="Triple Entente">Entente</a> <a href="/wiki/Men-of-war" class="mw-redirect" title="Men-of-war">men-of-war</a> were doing in the harbor and why they had fired on <a href="/wiki/Bolshevik" class="mw-redirect" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> troops, Koehler steadfastly and calmly parried the charges, insisting that no firing had occurred since <i>Talbot</i> anchored in the harbor, that the Americans were there for the sole purpose of evacuating <a href="/wiki/Refugees" class="mw-redirect" title="Refugees">refugees</a>, and that he understood the reason for prior naval gun fire was because Odessa had been occupied by "marauders and thieves" before the Red Army entered.  When Uborevich questioned Koehler about American opinion of Bolshevism and its recent victories, Koehler responded that he "had not been in America since the war, so he "did not know American opinion in detail, but that in general, I thought that American opinion was not impressed with the chance of success of any government based on the will of so minute a minority as that of the present Bolshevist regime."<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup> Koehler was initially told by Uborevich and a <a href="/wiki/Commisar" class="mw-redirect" title="Commisar">commisar</a> that they would need "word from Moscow" on his request to make contact with the Americans, that might take two or three days.  Koehler was able to expertly manipulate around the delay and avoid becoming an extended "guest" of the Reds.  When Uborevich asked Koehler what he thought of the recent Red victories, Koehler told him that his impression was that the Red advance was more an example of the weakness of Denikin's forces than the strength of the Red Army.

I could not believe my eyes when I beheld a tall man entering my room dressed in a black cloak, conveyed by two armed Bolshevists.  Is it possible?  An AMERICAN OFFICER, I exclaimed.... Lt. Cmdr. Hugo W. Koehler-- came close, he said, 'Yes, it is possible; here I am to help you, as I know you are sick."  I broke down, crying like a child, and begged the kind officer to take me to America, to my Mother, as I had no one in Odessa but my beloved husband's grave...  During the sad scene one of the armed Bolshevists took stations at the door, and the other, evidently knowing the English language, came closer to hear the conversation. Lieutenant Commander Koehler tried to quiet me, explaining that he had orders to take the refugees to Constantinople only.  The neighbors hearing this, advised me to remain, as I was too ill to travel.  Lieutenant Commander Koehler, also finding this best, advised me to stay.... Thinking that I was in need, he offered me money... and he assured me that I was not in danger, and if he found out that I was, he would come and take me with him.  After he left, my friend explained to me that his (Koehler's) life was in danger, as there was no government to be responsible if anything should happen to him.... [I] prayed to be in a position to come to the United States some day in order to find Lieutenant Commander Koehler and to thank him personally and to tell the world that there are still some noble and kind people who will endanger their lives to help a little, weak woman, a mere stranger."

This I did and was put on board a Turkish steamer and reached Constantinople safely."<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99">&#91;99&#93;</a></sup>  After Koehler had made arrangements with the Reds to secure Keyser's safety and eventual evacuation to Constantinople, with his Red escort he next visited the addresses of three American men, and determined that two had already made it safely out of Odessa; however, the third was believed to be in the city and "strongly suspected of pro-Bolshevik leanings".  Koehler was then taken back to Red headquarters, where he was able to delay his voluntary departure for a day, and make further observations as he walked ten miles through the besieged city. "I entered two food shops and although there was not a great abundance of supplies, both shops had customers buying food.

Now in March, it was a disastrous, headlong retreat into the port of Novorossiysk that Denikin had made no provisions for.  Instead, while many in the White army and navy had called on Denikin to replace the incompetent Shilling with Wrangel, Denikin had banished Wrangel, a respected and highly competent soldier, to <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup>  The end of Denikin's army came amidst a brutal winter, and a <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">Typhoid fever</a> epidemic.

Around noon, fires broke out by the railway yards and waterfront, which soon became uncontrolled infernos, consuming buildings, warehouses, ammunition, oil and rolling stock worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Tons of weapons, tanks, armored cars and munitions were pushed off the docks into the harbor. As Koehler described it, "Ships lying alongside the docks crowded on human cargo almost to the last inch of space and then, fearing the fire, moved away from the piers into the stream, although they made almost no impression on the multitude seeking to board.  Packed on the docks and beach, surrounded by raging fire, were thousands who had hoped and expected to be taken away, but who had been left behind for lack of ships to embark them.

"Upon arrival at the outskirts of Melitopol we found Reds still held Melitopol station and were bombarding the town from armored trains at a distance, but the south Russian forces  had occupied the main part of town.  I continued on into the town and went at once to headquarters where I found General Tsichetski installed in the building hurriedly vacated a few hours previously by the Bolshevik Central Committee."  At his request, Koehler was given three cossacks to accompany him to the address he had earlier obtained from a prisoner for the headquarters of the Bolshevik Tchresvichaika. Breaking the locks, the group began collecting up the papers that seemed of value, until seeing a group of White cavalry galloping by, they learned they were caught in the middle of Red troops that had counter-attacked and reentered the city. Rather than try to flee, Koehler and his party commandeered a cart and hid with their load of papers by a flour mill for a few hours, until the Red troops themselves retreated with White cavalry on their flank.

While engaged in this work the town was recaptured by the Bolshevik troops and Lt. Cmdr. Koehler for several hours was cut off from the troops which he accompanied. He managed to conceal himself and in addition saved the papers which he had secured and which were of much value."

In his report, Koehler recounted his interviews with the administrator in Melitopol, "He said his guiding idea was that this is a civil war, a struggle between Russians-- Russians of widely different ideas, to be sure-- but Russians; in short, the occupied area is not to be treated as conquered territory but must be administered so people will understand that the new regime is working for them and with them, not against them... [he] stated the first plan had been to give the land to the peasants without payment of any kind, but peasants would not believe that land received for nothing was actually theirs; ...[unless] they could pay actual money for the land, receive a receipt for such payment, and take home a paper with a large red seal that said the land was theirs..."<sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">&#91;119&#93;</a></sup> </p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Russian_Volunteer_Army_troops_guarding_the_warehouse_of_the_American_Red_Cross.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Russian_Volunteer_Army_troops_guarding_the_warehouse_of_the_American_Red_Cross.jpg/220px-Russian_Volunteer_Army_troops_guarding_the_warehouse_of_the_American_Red_Cross.jpg" decoding="async" width="220" height="329" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Russian_Volunteer_Army_troops_guarding_the_warehouse_of_the_American_Red_Cross.jpg/330px-Russian_Volunteer_Army_troops_guarding_the_warehouse_of_the_American_Red_Cross.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Russian_Volunteer_Army_troops_guarding_the_warehouse_of_the_American_Red_Cross.jpg/440px-Russian_Volunteer_Army_troops_guarding_the_warehouse_of_the_American_Red_Cross.jpg 2x" data-file-width="647" data-file-height="969" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Russian_Volunteer_Army_troops_guarding_the_warehouse_of_the_American_Red_Cross.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Russian <a href="/wiki/Volunteer_Army" title="Volunteer Army">Volunteer Army</a> troops guarding <a href="/wiki/American_Red_Cross" title="American Red Cross">American Red Cross</a> medical supplies, June 1920</div></div></div>
<p>In a letter to Dolly Gladstone, Koehler gently chided her for Britain's investment in Denikin, having lately turned its sympathy from the cause of the White Russians under Denikin's successor, Wrangel, to the Bolshevists, "I'm afraid your experiment in backing Denikin has been much more costly for you and for Russia and for the world than the simple L400,000,000 (in stores, etc.,) you ventured on the project... Poor old Denikin- simple, honest, and a patriot, but undoubtedly one of the stupidest men who ever came into power in any country. Surrounded by incompetents and dishonesty, badly advised by his allies, he distinguished himself by not one single sound or wise measure. If he had thrown dice for every decision he would have improved just fifty percent.  General Wrangel is of a different caliber: fine soldier, good general, honest, capable, full of courage and initiative, no great statesman, but he knows it and surrounds himself with men who can take care of that end of the game... His miracles continue. But he cannot beat bolshevism by force of arms- nor can any army.  Bolshevism fattens on military opposition. It will collapse without it... I like the Russians, immensely so, in fact, and we've become great friends.... General Kutepov (the commander of the First Corps) and I have become sworn brothers.  He is about the finest type of soldierman I've ever seen- and I'm very fond of him.  Many other of my friends are not as estimable, I am afraid, for about all the brigands, thieves, murderers, and similar pleasant scoundrels that disturb the peace hereabouts count themselves among my intimate friends... It is difficult to keep things in a land such as this, when the need is so great; one has almost a guilty feeling if one owns a sheet or an extra shirt. So long ago I gave away all I had, and now if I had a sheet or an extra shirt I wouldn't know what to do with it except to give it to some poor woman to make a child's dress... I'm afraid I've given you a rather chaotic picture of it all- but you might take the chaotic effect simply as a bit of realism, for life is indeed chaos here; it resembles reasonable conditions just about as much as that famous <a href="/wiki/Cubist" class="mw-redirect" title="Cubist">cubist</a> picture <a href="/wiki/Nude_Descending_a_Staircase,_No._2" title="Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2">Nude Descending a Stair</a> resembles anything real.  In the first months I was here I accumulated great stacks of loot, from pictures and furs to old earrings and relics.  But I've decided to take none of it from Russia.  I've given it all away again."  Koehler's appeal on behalf of the suffering masses in Russia did not fall on deaf ears.  Rear Admiral McCully's July 15, 1920 report to the Secretary of State noted, "Recently representatives of a British Fund established by Lady Muriel Paget have established a hospital in Sebastopol, and a <a href="/wiki/British_Red_Cross" title="British Red Cross">British Red Cross</a> and Children's Relief Organization are also at work."<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">&#91;120&#93;</a></sup>

The Bolsheviks, recognizing their vulnerability in a two-front war, did not seek to engage the Poles.  However, <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski" title="JÃ³zef PiÅsudski">Marshal PiÅsudski</a>, the Polish head of state had plans to annex the Ukrainian and White Russian provinces.

His troops consisted almost entirely of officers in the hope that in the first possible moment the army would be expanded by entrance of peasants. Wrangel's army was equipped with tanks, cannons, and airplanes better than all the other armies which had fought in Russia. While we fought the Poles, Wrangel gathered his forces."<sup id="cite_ref-REGB60UPWMC_p._266-267_113-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-REGB60UPWMC_p._266-267-113">&#91;113&#93;</a></sup> While Wrangel's army tried to solidify its holdings in the northern Tauride, Koehler spent much of July and August sorting and translating the trove of documents he had snatched from Bolshevik headquarters in Melitopol, with a brief visit to the front on July 20.  The tide again turned against Wrangel's forces in the middle of August, when the Polish forces defeated the Soviets on the outskirts of <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>.  After the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920)" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Vistula</a>, with nearly 70,000 Red soldiers taken prisoner, the ensuing peace with Poland signalled the eventual end of Wrangel's regime, with the full force of the Red army now freed to focus on the Crimea.<sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121">&#91;121&#93;</a></sup> But the end was still a couple months away, and on August 27, Koehler left by train from Sebastopol to Melitopol, where he called on General Kutepov at his First Army headquarters.  "Even General Kutepov himself with all his indomitable energy plainly showed from overwork... He explained that although strictly military considerations might demand a withdrawal from the present extensive front on account of the heavy cost in casualties in holding so long a line against superior numbers, he felt that political conditions and loyalty to the inhabitants of the occupied territory who had aided Russian forces (and many of those younger men were now in the army), demanded that the Tauride be held at almost any cost."<sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">&#91;122&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Perhaps Koehler did not see, or chose to overlook another side of Kutepov, his "sworn brother", who along with Pisarev, commonly executed people without trial and for minimal cause. Earlier that year, as military governor of Sebastopol, his number of executions and cruelty sparked complaints among the peasants and civic leaders. One particularly egregious instance, was the hanging of a young <a href="/wiki/Tatars" title="Tatars">Tartar</a> poet, accused of nothing but vague, Bolshevist sympathies.  Complaints were sent to Wrangel, and rather than investigate the claims, Wrangel summoned the mayor of Sebastopol before him. Recalling in his memoirs years later what he told the politician, Wrangel wrote, "I know all about your disagreement with General Kutepov, who is merely carrying out my orders. I am not going to discuss with you who is right, or which of us two has given orders. I am responsible to the Army and to the people, and I follow the dictates of my science. I am quite sure that were you in my place you would act differently; but as it happens destiny has given me and not you direction of the Russian Cause, and I will stop at nothing in the accomplishment of my duty, and I will not hesitate to cut down anyone who tries to stop me.  You protest because General Kutepov has hanged a score or so of men who were a danger to the Army and to the Cause. I warn you should the necessity arise I would not hesitate to increase the number by one, and that one would be you."  During the Russian Civil War, many White generals and a number of the Bolshevist leaders developed a great propensity for cruelty and summary executions.  They came to believe in violence for the sake of violence, to send a strong message to the enemy.  It likely was counterproductive, as it only alienated and frightened the silent majority of citizens, while firming the enemy's resolve.<sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123">&#91;123&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Leaving Melitopol, Koehler went to Feodorovka and visited the headquarters of General Pisarev, Commander of Third Corps.  As Koehler sardonically described the meeting, "He reviewed the military situation and seemed confident of success of his encircling movement, begun some two days before with the object of breaking through in rear of the advancing Red column and then surrounding it. Present tactics, both Bolshevik and Russian, represent nothing so much as a giant game of cross-tag: each side attempts to cut in behind the other, then to outflank the other's flanking column, then again to outflank this outflanking, flanking column-- and so on..."<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124">&#91;124&#93;</a></sup>  Koehler described the front line he visited in August 1920, "Whenever I arrived on the fighting line, I found the division commander and his chief of staff in the front line or ahead of it, instead of in their classic post two miles in the rear. I noted a general of artillery with a rifle wound in his leg and a saber cut in the head, certainly a most unorthodox proceeding, but here the artillery is immediately behind the infantry if not on the line with it.... Under cover of machine gun fire, the entire Russian line now took up the advance, moving in echelon at good speed... We now gained a slight eminence from which we had an excellent view of the entire movement, including the retreat of the Reds.  [The Whites] were outnumbered about 3 to 1, but in actual battle the Red superiority in numbers really had comparatively little consequence on this front; they had encountered some single regiments that were worth more than other entire divisions. However, in maneuvering and the possibility of exerting a general pressure all along the line, numbers were of course, very valuable.  The general said that regiments composed entirely of Communists invariably fought well, as also did the <a href="/wiki/Latvians" title="Latvians">Latvians</a> and certain international regiments made up mostly of <a href="/wiki/Magyars" class="mw-redirect" title="Magyars">Magyars</a>...."<sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup> On August 27, Koehler was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_St._Vladimir" class="mw-redirect" title="Order of St. Vladimir">Order of St. Vladimir, fourth class, with swords and bow</a> by Kutepov. A telegram from General <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Vitkovsky" title="Vladimir Vitkovsky">Vladimir Vitkovsky</a> that was found in Koehler's papers years later reads, "With the feeling of sincere pleasure I learn that you have been awarded, sir, with the Order of St. Vladimir, 4th Class, with swords and bow and congratulate you with this high award, which commemorates the day of your visit to the fighting line of my corps." This, and two other Russian Imperial decorations, were among the last awarded to a foreigner or a Russian for that matter. As Koehler's published historiographer wrote, "The strict neutrality of the American Mission, so scrupulously adhered to by Admiral McCully, was evidently less than a pressing concern for the Commander."<sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">&#91;126&#93;</a></sup>

Asking a farmer the price of wheat, as he complimented the man on the quality of his grain, Koehler was told, "Who could tell?" he answered. "He went on to explain that Bolsheviks took it for nothing, Wrangels forces offered sheaves of paper money for it- if that was standard, he added critically, it evidently must be worth something. Yet Bolsheviks came a long way for it, and Whites were extraordinarily anxious to get it, so it must have value for everyone except the man who had grown it." Koehler concluded that the conditions in "Red Russia" had been harder on the townspeople than the peasants.  "The more I learned directly of conditions in Red Russia... the more evident it becomes that it is townspeople who suffered most from the Bolsheviks and conditions brought about by the Red regime.  They gladly welcomed the Russian troops and quickly aligned themselves with the new Wrangel regime.  Peasants, although they suffered a certain loss from seizure of grain and horses, and although bitter against mobilization, nevertheless in general never suffered any hunger or the many requisitions of clothing, linen, household effects, and about everything else of value townspeople had to endure; nor have they seen at close hand the conduct and methods of the <a href="/wiki/Commissars" class="mw-redirect" title="Commissars">commissars</a>... In these years the man who produces from the soil is king- even in Red Russia... But the spirit of the townspeople is broken- their brains and wills are as weak and starved from lack of food as are their bodies- sufferings have left them exhausted.  Once these townspeople get sufficient food inside them to restore stamina, and when the interior weakness of bolshevism gives them an opportunity, they must restore commerce and industry, yet the latter would also restore the towns- and strengthened, people would no longer submit to the tyranny they have suffered for years. So even in its success, bolshevism contains the elements of its downfall.  The millworker in Alimovka expressed the idea of thousands when he said that formerly the Russians had a <a href="/wiki/Czar" class="mw-redirect" title="Czar">czar</a>, a fool, to rule them, [and] taxes were very bad, but bread was five <a href="/wiki/Russian_ruble" title="Russian ruble">kopeks</a> a pound and plentiful, and a man could get all the shirts, and shoes, and sugar and tea and tobacco he wanted. Now Russia was ruled by very clever men, [and] there were no taxes at all, but bread was 500 rubles a pound and scarce, and neither shirts nor shoes nor sugar nor tea nor tobacco were to be had."<sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127">&#91;127&#93;</a></sup>

Dratsenko, consisting of the old Second and Third Corps and a <a href="/wiki/Terek_Cossacks" title="Terek Cossacks">Terek Cossacks</a> brigade. Wrangel also formed two independent <a href="/wiki/Cavalry" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> units, led by General Ivan Barbovich and the <a href="/wiki/Kuban" title="Kuban">Kuban</a> Cossack General Nikolai Babiev. At that time, Wrangel's forces totaled 43,900.<sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-128">&#91;128&#93;</a></sup> Kutepov was confident that there were no significant Bolshevik forces between Alexandrovsk, <a href="/wiki/Ekaterinoslav" class="mw-redirect" title="Ekaterinoslav">Ekaterinoslav</a> or <a href="/wiki/Kharkov" class="mw-redirect" title="Kharkov">Kharkov</a>, and felt he could take either town without great effort.

M. Agaev. Forming his bodyguard and transport train into the "enemy", he sent them in one direction and his own force disappeared in a cloud of dust in the opposite direction. Thirty minutes later we noted, from our position on the top of an old <a href="/wiki/Tatars" title="Tatars">Tartar</a> <a href="/wiki/Burial_mound" class="mw-redirect" title="Burial mound">burial mound</a>, a mass of cavalry approaching in a solid formation.  This mass soon spread into a long, thin line, which came on at a gallop.  In the meantime, the enemy came and in a brilliant charge pierced the advancing line, which then split into two parts that retreated to the flanks, apparently in considerable disorder. At this point, the reserve hidden behind the advancing line suddenly came into sight, but on seeing the advancing enemy, it too wheeled and beat a hasty retreat with the enemy in hot pursuit. As the enemy pressed forward, the second reserve suddenly swept down and engaged the enemy in front, while the retreating first reserve, which had made a rather wide turn, now attacked on the enemy's flank while the two parts of the first line, which had retreated in apparent disorder, now came plunging in from the opposite flank and the rear, thus attacking the enemy from all sides at once.  The result was a melee of men and horses, sabres and lances, banners and streamers, a whirlwind of dust. If battle is half as dangerous as this maneuver appears, one wonders how there can be any enemies of Cossacks left." During the inspection of the Cavalry Corps, Koehler witnessed General Wigran's entire brigade, cavalry, artillery and machine gun detachments charge up the reviewing hillock, and led by the general, give a rousing cheer, "America, America".  Koehler learned it was the result of his giving a transcript to General Kutepov of a lengthy address by the Secretary of State that acknowledged the U.S. "strongly recoils [from] recognition of the Bolshevist regime," going on to say, the "United States feels that friendship and honor require that Russia's interests must be generously protected and... [we] have so instructed [our] representative in Southern Russia, Rear Admiral Newton A. McCully."

Although peace negotiations between the Poles and Soviets only began on September 21, Wrangel knew he had to make his push across the Dnieper, realizing that Marshal <a href="/wiki/Semyon_Budyonny" title="Semyon Budyonny">Semyon Budyonny</a>'s <a href="/wiki/1st_Cavalry_Army" title="1st Cavalry Army">First Cavalry</a> would arrive from the Polish front to join with Red commander <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Frunze" title="Mikhail Frunze">Mikhail Frunze</a>'s <a href="/wiki/6th_Army_(RSFSR)" title="6th Army (RSFSR)">Sixth</a> and <a href="/wiki/13th_Army_(RSFSR)" title="13th Army (RSFSR)">Thirteenth Armies</a> and <a href="/wiki/2nd_Cavalry_Army" title="2nd Cavalry Army">Second Cavalry</a>, headquartered at <a href="/wiki/Kharkov" class="mw-redirect" title="Kharkov">Kharkov</a>, dramatically increasing the numerical advantage of the Reds.  As observed by Koehler, the White army's operation came "within an ace of success" but it was not to be. After the capture of 3,000 Reds on October 11, Babiev's cavalry outflanked the thorn of Kahovka while Wrangel's First Army under Kutepov north of Melitopol cut elements of the Soviet Sixth and Thirteenth armies to ribbons. Then key events conspired to doom the operation.  On October 13, Wrangel ordered a frontal assault by General Vitkovsky on Kahovka.  Inaccurate aerial reconnaissance reported sparse defenses; however, the city was heavily defended and Vitovsky's tanks were destroyed.  As Babiev's Cossacks were about to surround the city, he was killed by an artillery shell, thoroughly confounding and demoralizing his Cossacks, who began to retreat. This, in turn, caused the inept Second Army commander, Dratsenko, to order a general retreat back to the left bank of the Dnieper.  When the Whites regrouped on the left bank, they found that the Markov and <a href="/wiki/Lavr_Kornilov" title="Lavr Kornilov">Kornilov</a> divisions, General Babiev and his cavalry, Barbovich's corps, and the Sixth and Seventh Infantry divisions had been crushed and abandoned on the right bank.<sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-134">&#91;134&#93;</a></sup> On top of these failures, news reached Wrangel that the Poles and Soviets had signed a peace treaty the previous day, October 12.  Wrangel's forces began a steady retreat and any designs on spreading into the Ukraine were finished. Koehler returned to Sebastopol on October 17, as once again, thousands of beaten and despondent Whites retreated toward the narrow Perekop Isthmus and Sivash straights that separated Crimea from the northern Tauride.  On the day of the Red's first offensive, October 28, they had 99,500 infantry and 33,700 cavalry to the White's 23,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry- nearly a 4 to 1 advantage.

<p>A week later, Koehler was in Yalta with McCully who wrote in his diary, "Summer is definitely over, although Koehler still goes in swimming." Wrangel had hoped that the tidal marshes at the neck of the Crimea would hold back the Bolsheviks, but a series of very low tides drained many and a cold spell froze over the rest, so that the Reds poured over, sending his remaining forces into full retreat to <a href="/wiki/Sebastopol" class="mw-redirect" title="Sebastopol">Sebastopol</a> and a desperate <a href="/wiki/Rearguard" title="Rearguard">rearguard action</a>. He described the end of his campaign, "I gave the order in October 1920 for retreat. The troops fell back by forced marches on the seaports and embarked according to a plan previously arranged.

The area of the new state ceded from Germany included the agrarian regions of <a href="/wiki/Pomeranian_Voivodeship_(1919%E2%80%931939)" title="Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919â1939)">Pomerania</a> and <a href="/wiki/Province_of_Posen" title="Province of Posen">Posen</a>, plus the industrial regions of <a href="/wiki/Upper_Silesia" title="Upper Silesia">Prussian Upper Silesia</a>.

The goal of establishing a unified nation from these diverse regions, with differing taxes, varying public education (to the extent it existed) and transportation infrastructure, was compounded by the destruction of six years of war on both cities and farmlands.<sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-150">&#91;150&#93;</a></sup></p><div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Hugo_W._Koehler_in_1921.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Hugo_W._Koehler_in_1921.jpg/300px-Hugo_W._Koehler_in_1921.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="242" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Hugo_W._Koehler_in_1921.jpg/450px-Hugo_W._Koehler_in_1921.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/22/Hugo_W._Koehler_in_1921.jpg 2x" data-file-width="552" data-file-height="445" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Hugo_W._Koehler_in_1921.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Hugo W. Koehler in 1921</div></div></div>
<p>In a letter to Capt. William Galbraith of the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Intelligence" title="Office of Naval Intelligence">Office of Naval Intelligence</a> in early November, 1921, Koehler wrote of driving from Warsaw to Danzig, where he "passed in and out of Germany and Poland so often that we soon lost count of the number of frontier stations."  Motoring from battle-scarred, <a href="/wiki/Brest-Litovsk" class="mw-redirect" title="Brest-Litovsk">Brest-Litovsk</a> he wrote that, "The most interesting thing there was the scrawl on the wall of the room where the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk" title="Treaty of Brest-Litovsk">Bolshevik treaty with Germany</a> was signed. 'Neither Peace, nor War.' it reads, and is signed 'Leon Trotksy, December 1917, Brest'- certainly not a bad estimate of the situation, especially so, considering the date."  Heading on towards <a href="/wiki/Baranowicze" class="mw-redirect" title="Baranowicze">Baranowicze</a>, Koehler's party travelled through miles of burned land, for which he observed that,  "[I]n accordance with age-old Russian strategy the armies laid waste the countryside as they retreated... Wonderfully thorough they were, these poor Russians, in destroying their own houses and fields."<sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">&#91;151&#93;</a></sup> Arriving at the border, they found "a long line of prairie schooners coming in. 'Is this Poland? Are we out of Russia? God be praised!' came again and again in the same jabbering Russian, Polish and German.  It happened that in this crowd were German colonists from Russia. They had been in Russia for many generations, they had never mixed with the Russians but kept close together in their little farm colonies along the <a href="/wiki/Volga_River" title="Volga River">Volga</a>.... I talked to one peasant who was under twenty-seven although he looked over forty- and  small wonder, for he had tramped over five thousand versts and during the last stretch had dragged the cart himself, as the Bolsheviks had taken away his horse. I examined the cart he had brought all this distance and with so tremendous an effort. An old bed, bits of sacking, an assortment of battered pots and pans, an old sheepskin, part of a wolfskin, rags, nine potatoes, a handful of radishes, some pieces of tallow- nothing else. The complete inventory would not net a dollar; he explained that he had had a cow but the Bolsheviks had taken it away from him at the border. Yet he was much better off than thousands, for having been out in the open he was in comparatively good health although drawn and wasted, whereas the others who had come back by train were feeble and diseased and bleeding from bites. The children of course, were the most tragic sights.  They are young only when they smile."<sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">&#91;152&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>
In his travels through Germany, when Koehler met German women with babies, he would ask them if they were raising them to be <i>canonenfutter</i> (cannon fodder).  Invariably, they would respond, " 'No,' indignantly.  But on further talking, they would just as invariably intimate that these boys would have to someday fight as their fathers did, because the French would not let them do otherwise.<i>Frankreich muss noch weinen</i>." ("The French will be made to weep again"), Koehler heard over, and over.<sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-153">&#91;153&#93;</a></sup> He saw that Germany was selling its goods below the actual cost of production, and that while full employment might postpone the "crash", when it came it would be harder due to Germany's weak financial condition.  "To pull through, Germany will need statesmanship wiser than the greed of manufacturers that has been the directing force since the Armistice. As it is, the German people seem blighted with the curse of false leaders, for the interests now at the helm, though more greedy than the old, are less farsighted; and again the German people will suffer for their lack of ability in choosing leaders...." A French officer travelling with Koehler for part of his journey, expressed bitterness seeing "all the smiling fields, and all the beautiful villages, and all the sturdy Germans working so industriously, all the busy factories at <a href="/wiki/D%C3%BCsseldorf" title="DÃ¼sseldorf">DÃ¼sseldorf</a> and <a href="/wiki/Essen" title="Essen">Essen</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ruhr" title="Ruhr">Ruhr</a>..." while "he thought of devastated northern France."  The sight of the German resolve and energy "struck terror to the soul of my French friend," prompting Koehler's conclusion that, "The tragedy is not only that the French do not realize that by keeping an army beyond their means they are weakening themselves, but the fear and terror that they all feel makes it impossible for them even to understand it until that terror is removed."<sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-154">&#91;154&#93;</a></sup> </p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Lt._Cdr._Hugo_W._Koehler_Naval_Attache_Passport.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Lt._Cdr._Hugo_W._Koehler_Naval_Attache_Passport.jpg/300px-Lt._Cdr._Hugo_W._Koehler_Naval_Attache_Passport.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="179" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Lt._Cdr._Hugo_W._Koehler_Naval_Attache_Passport.jpg/450px-Lt._Cdr._Hugo_W._Koehler_Naval_Attache_Passport.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Lt._Cdr._Hugo_W._Koehler_Naval_Attache_Passport.jpg/600px-Lt._Cdr._Hugo_W._Koehler_Naval_Attache_Passport.jpg 2x" data-file-width="5017" data-file-height="2993" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Lt._Cdr._Hugo_W._Koehler_Naval_Attache_Passport.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Lt. Cdr. Hugo Koehler's Diplomatic Passport Application, Naval AttachÃ© to Poland, August 1921</div></div></div>
<p>Journeying through Poland, Koehler engaged in discussions of the viability of the new Polish republic.  "And over and over again one hears it stated that if there had been any real vitality in the idea of a Polish nationality, the Poles would long ago have thrown off the yoke of the oppressors they hated so bitterly.  But however sound these statements may be in themselves, I do not find they quite fit the Polish situation. It is all very well to say that a country should itself throw off the yoke if it aspires to nationhood, but when all is said and done, once Poland was partitioned, it was really impossible for Poland to rise until at least one of the oppressors had fallen. It is true that a country must itself achieve its independence, since the fundamental character of independence is that it cannot be received as a gift.... Poland has been reborn and has a fine start in life, but whether or not Poland will ever arrive at manhood depends entirely on the Poles. There is no royal road to knowledge, we were told as children, nor is there any royal road to manhood or statehood."  Koehler recalled the "feeling in General Wrangel's army when the Poles were advancing to <a href="/wiki/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>.  Although Wrangel's men were fighting for existence against the Bolsheviks, in the hardest and bitterest kind of fight, still there was a time, at the height of the Polish advance, when the feeling in Wrangel's army was such that they would almost have made common cause with the Bolsheviks rather than see the Poles advance into Russia."<sup id="cite_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-155">&#91;155&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In a letter to his mother, Mathilda, written in July 1922, Koehler recounted that, "In the forest region there are many Jews in the little villages that here consist usually of a single row of houses around a square instead of the single, very broad street of the Russian style.  I heard many complaints against the Jews: that they did no real work, no farming, no cutting of wood, yet they became rich on the labors of the peasants. 'If they do not farm and do not cut wood, then what do the Jews do?' I asked a peasant. 'Oh, they buy stolen logs and trade stolen horses and sell vodka,' was the answer. 'You wicked <a href="/wiki/Anti-Semitic" class="mw-redirect" title="Anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> <a href="/wiki/Propagandist" class="mw-redirect" title="Propagandist">propagandist</a>!' I reproached him; but his only reply was that just nine days before, his brother's horse had been stolen and found at a Jew's house seventeen versts away, and that currently everybody knew that Jews bought the stolen logs and cattle as well as the horses. 'But the peasants must steal the logs first in order to sell them to the Jews,' I answered. 'Yes,' he admitted, 'but if the Jews did not buy, the peasants would not steal.'  I told him the parable about the pot and the kettle, but he was not impressed."<sup id="cite_ref-156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-156">&#91;156&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Koehler recalled a particularly humorous encounter with frontier posts and visa stamps that again demonstrated his prodigious ability to persuade and manipulate.  Motoring to <a href="/wiki/Kovno" class="mw-redirect" title="Kovno">Kovno</a>, about ninety minutes after crossing the <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuanian</a> frontier and a small army post where Koehler's <a href="/wiki/Retinue" title="Retinue">retinue</a> had asked directions, they came upon a line of soldiers with <a href="/wiki/Bayoneted" class="mw-redirect" title="Bayoneted">bayoneted</a> rifles gesturing urgently.  An officer approached and told them they would need to go back to the frontier outpost for Koehler to have his passport stamped. Not wanting to backtrack over "very bad roads" and delay the trip for this bureaucratic exercise, Koehler "refused point-blank to go back but added that I would be glad to go to any station in the direction of Kovno, my destination."  Ultimately taking the phone himself, he "talked to various regimental commanders, divisional commanders, and goodness knows what, all of whom repeated that the frontier was closed inasmuch as Poland and Lithuania were at war, and that I could therefore not have passed the frontier.  In reply I suggested that the mere fact I was in the middle of Lithuania ought to be sufficient evidence that I had crossed the frontier.  I replied that I would not go willingly and that under the circumstances I considered that the same <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a> that applied to <a href="/wiki/Blockade" title="Blockade">blockades</a> also applied to a frontier; that is, that just as a blockade in order to be binding must be effective, so it was with a frontier."  Standing his ground, Koehler's suggestion that he should be allowed to proceed to divisional headquarters (on the way to Kovno) was finally agreed to.  Reaching divisional headquarters, "the first result was more discussions, telephoning, arguing, and beseeching. But the <a href="/wiki/Upshot" class="mw-redirect" title="Upshot">upshot</a> of it all was that instead of proceeding to Kovno, I was told I should have to wait where I was until the Lithuanian Foreign Office had authorized the visa of my passport... However, as this process promised to take a good many hours if not days and weeks, and as the discussion had already lasted some four and a half hours, I cast about for a happy idea." Koehler matter of factly suggested  to the general's <a href="/wiki/Adjutant" title="Adjutant">adjutant</a> that he had only heard the Polish side of the controversy with Lithuania, and that it might be very interesting on the journey to Kovno to have "a really thorough explanation of the Lithuanian side of the case. The effect of this gentle hint was electric! The adjutant dashed off to his colonel, and within three minutes the answer came back that I could proceed at once to Kovno, and that, if I wished it, an officer would accompany me and show me the way." Koehler arrived at Kovno without further incident.<sup id="cite_ref-157" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-157">&#91;157&#93;</a></sup>

In this assignment he met the <a href="/wiki/Papal_Nuncios" class="mw-redirect" title="Papal Nuncios">Papal Nuncios</a> to Poland and Germany, Archbishops Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti and Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli.  The unfounded speculation surrounding these meetings, was that the Vatican and Koehler were discussing the potential for restoration of the <a href="/wiki/Habsburg" class="mw-redirect" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> empire, relative to the rumor that Koehler was the "lost" crown prince. The following year, Ratti became <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI" title="Pope Pius XI">Pope Pius XI</a>, and on his death in 1939, Pacelli was elected to the papacy, taking the name <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a>.

</p><p>Returning to the United States several days later, on leave before his next assignment, Koehler visited his mother, Mathilda, in Davenport, Iowa, during the <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> holidays and gave an interview to the local paper. Titled "Worse Times Coming in Germany", Koehler saw Germany at the beginning of a period of economic <a href="/wiki/Deflation" title="Deflation">deflation</a> following the hyperinflation that had existed since the Armistice.  While the current economic situation made it doubtful there would be any significant rise in exports to Europe, Koehler believed there was great future trade expansion potential since the old and new European nations did not believe the U.S. was "animated by ulterior motives".  He noted that America loans money to those nations, not "loans" in the form of imported goods made in Britain as the British did. He saw Germany paying the price of Anglo-French political maneuvers in the <a href="/wiki/Near_East" title="Near East">Near East</a>, where the English were defeated in their diplomatic backing of Greece, as the French were victors in their backing of Turkey.  That victory gave the French the courage to insist on their strong army policy towards the Germans.  The balance of trade that was formerly in favor of Germany, was now against it, which augured ill for German prosperity.  He reaffirmed his belief that Russia "will eventually escape domination of the bolshevik" but saw no possibility of ever reverting to a monarchy, since the peasants, who had "appropriated many things in addition to land" would resist it.  Koehler saw Poland as "economically wealthy" with its tremendous natural resources of timber, oil, coal and mining, but "financially poor" for supporting a very large standing army and a close alliance with France. Politically, he regarded the situation in Poland as "perplexing", with 17 political parties, and strong political minorities of Germans, Russians, Jews and Ukrainians. He noted that 90 percent of the emigration from Poland was Jewish. Koehler opined that while all European nations worried over the invasion threat of the <a href="/wiki/Red_army" class="mw-redirect" title="Red army">Red army</a>, they were "bluffed" since it was defensively, not offensively strong. "The Russian army has no artillery, no aviation force, no means of supply and while it could defend Russia effectively it could not campaign efficiently in an aggressive way," he stated. Commenting about "The Terrible Turk", Koehler felt it wasn't so "terrible" after all. "There isn't any danger in the present alliance between the Turk and the Bolshevik as far as a permanent threat against the peace of Europe is concerned. <a href="/wiki/Mohammedanism" class="mw-redirect" title="Mohammedanism">Mohammedanism</a> is fundamentally opposed to <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a> and therefore these two countries cannot remain friendly," Koehler accurately predicted. "Communism is a good excuse for a row but a poor foundation for a stable government," he declared.  The recent assassination of the Polish president, Narutowicz, a Lithuanian by birth who had been conciliatory in resolving the boundary dispute with Lithuania that followed the Poles taking of <a href="/wiki/Vilna" class="mw-redirect" title="Vilna">Vilna</a> was a serious blow to the country's future, Koehler believed. "America has done an enormous amount of good for Poland and for other new countries of Europe in its relief work, work that will eventually react to the benefit of the United States. For two years we fed over a million children in Poland and they are tremendously grateful to us.  The American businessman doesn't pay much attention to his foreign trade. We are too indifferent to find out the real market conditions. But we have great latent possibilities there as a result of our national activities in the past few years, possibilities which we will eventually capitalize."<sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">&#91;163&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Koehler was a popular, local speaker in Portsmouth and Newport Rhode, Island during the late 1930s and up until his death, sounding the warning against the rise of <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascism</a> in Europe and Asia and the danger of <a href="/wiki/Isolationism" title="Isolationism">isolationism</a>.  In an address titled, "<a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>- For What?", in January 1938, Koehler spoke to the "Monday Night Club" in Newport about his personal experiences and observations in Russia during 1920-21 and his meeting with Stalin in 1933. Stalin predicted to Koehler that America would achieve <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialism</a> more quickly and directly than the Soviet Union. Koehler recalled Russia in the years after World War I, when the White Russians and Bolsheviks battled for control of armies driven into the sea as they tried to reach the <a href="/wiki/Crimea" title="Crimea">Crimea</a>, and of the great famine and atrocities that were "unhappily too true."  He opined that the Bolsheviks were spurred on by an idealism of <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">liberty</a> that they had never enjoyed, put their hearts into the fight, and won.  Sent by the State Department to Russia, Koehler described his trip disguised as a Jewish <a href="/wiki/Peddler" title="Peddler">peddler</a>, on foot across Russia to Poland, and his studies of the masses.  Among the good points of the Bolshevik program, he pointed to the work-to-eat edict, education of the masses, and hospitalization for the children.  But he condemned the segregation and disruption of families, organization of an industrial production program and abolition of the <a href="/wiki/Labor_union" class="mw-redirect" title="Labor union">labor unions</a>.  Koehler said that the Bolsheviks considered unions and family life as a "menace" to <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">communism</a>. "There is more inequality in Russia today than under the old regime," he declared.  Recalling his interview of Stalin, who asked questions about America, and warned Koehler to  "Read Marx", he told of the Soviet leader predicting the U.S. would become a socialist state in the near future.<sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">&#91;194&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In September 1938, Koehler addressed the Newport Art Association on the subject "Is Europe Headed for War; Are We?" and made the initial point that "<a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> will probably continue to have victories of the kind that lead to defeat." His second point was that in a year Japan had "succeeded in giving <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> a unity that not all the centuries gave her."  Koehler asserted that the Chinese with a <a href="/wiki/Bayonet" title="Bayonet">bayonet</a> is superior man to man to the Japanese. The Japanese have agreed with the Fascist powers and the German advisor to <a href="/wiki/Chiang_Kaishek" class="mw-redirect" title="Chiang Kaishek">Chiang Kaishek</a>, General <a href="/wiki/Erich_von_Falkenhayn" title="Erich von Falkenhayn">Von Falkenhayn</a>, who had been  forced to withdraw from China because of pressures from Japan, told Hitler that Germany "has been backing the wrong horse" in Asia. Koehler observed that a militant Italy was a lesser threat than Germany with its greater population and resources.  He considered life under <a href="/wiki/Bolshevism" class="mw-redirect" title="Bolshevism">bolshevism</a> to be worse than life under <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascism</a>.  Concerning the immediate problem of Hitler's annexation of the <a href="/wiki/Sudetenland" title="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a>, Koehler reasoned that <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> would get little support from the other nations of the <a href="/wiki/Little_Entente" title="Little Entente">Little Entente</a> for fear of exposing themselves to attack from Germany.  Britain, however, would not fail to be on the side of France if war broke out.  He believed that under advisement of his high command, Hitler would "continue to capitalize on the fear of war and keep Europe in turmoil for some time to come and up to this day he has gained as much by bluff as he could get by war and without the disastrous cost of war."  Koehler's closing remark was half-accurate as history has bore out, "He will not resort to war. War would be the end of Hitler."<sup id="cite_ref-195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-195">&#91;195&#93;</a></sup>

He stated that <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was "bluffing" in September 1938, and would not have forced a war without <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy's</a> support. Overly optimistic, Koehler believed that France had the "strongest army" in Europe and was allied with Britain, but did not want to provoke a war.<sup id="cite_ref-196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-196">&#91;196&#93;</a></sup> In an April, 1939 address to the Men's Club of the <a href="/wiki/United_Congregational_Church_(Newport,_Rhode_Island)" title="United Congregational Church (Newport, Rhode Island)">United Congregational Church (Newport, Rhode Island)</a>, Koehler predicted that if war were to break out, the United States would be drawn into it.  "<a href="/wiki/Mussolini" class="mw-redirect" title="Mussolini">Mussolini</a> is afraid of war and Hitler doesn't want it," he said.  Taking questions from the audience, Koehler at that time believed that the dictator nations would achieve their goals without engaging other nations in war.<sup id="cite_ref-197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-197">&#91;197&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Koehler delivered an address to the Newport Electric Corporation's Men's Club on October 14, 1939, and warned that if the current arms embargo by the United States were not lifted, the war in Europe would be over within a month.  Great Britain and France could not continue without U.S. assistance in munitions and supplies. On the other hand, Koehler observed, Hitler "is in a jam" since Germany has to conserve her supplies for a possible later fight with Russia.  Hitler's alliance with Russia came at a "stiff price" by alienating <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> entirely and weakening Germany's support in <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>.  Had Spain gone along with Germany, <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Franco" title="Francisco Franco">Franco</a> could have mobilized an army on the border and forced <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> to do likewise, drawing men from the German front.  "Great Britain", he pointed out, "made a smart move in its trade pact with Russia, in that it can take what it needs, at the same time, keeping these imports and supplies from Germany. "Stalin," he said, "is only interested in Russia, and will be with any country that can put gold into Moscow."  Koehler offered that the present British government was "in poor hands" with <a href="/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain" title="Neville Chamberlain">Chamberlain</a> as <a href="/wiki/British_prime_minister" class="mw-redirect" title="British prime minister">prime minister</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sir_John_Simon" class="mw-redirect" title="Sir John Simon">Sir John Simon</a> as <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">head of the treasury</a>, since both men believed in keeping arms spending low.  Aside from Britain "blundering" in its negotiations with Germany preceding the war, Koehler observed that Britain made a strategic error in "building battleships, which are only good to fight other battleships.  A blockade could be effected as well with destroyers." He reasoned that Germany had not used its <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" title="Luftwaffe">air force</a> to break the embargo due to the high cost of ammunition, as it would require many planes dropping hundreds of bombs to sink a warship.  Koehler considered Mussolini "wise" to stay out of the conflict because Italy's "army is not strong enough to make a good showing."  As to <a href="/wiki/Gibraltar" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malta" title="Malta">Malta</a>, they are no longer the "towers of strength" due to airplanes which could launch bombing attacks in the darkness.  Koehler saw the war on the <a href="/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_II)" title="Western Front (World War II)">Western Front</a> as being a "perfect stalemate" due to the <a href="/wiki/Maginot_Line" title="Maginot Line">Maginot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siegfried_line" class="mw-redirect" title="Siegfried line">Siegfried lines</a>, overestimating in particular the false impregnability of the Maginot line. As to the German <a href="/wiki/U-boat" title="U-boat">U-boat</a> and aerial offensive, he thought it "possible but not probable" that Britain's blockade would be broken.<sup id="cite_ref-198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-198">&#91;198&#93;</a></sup>

We are in as bad a state today as the <a href="/wiki/French_people" title="French people">French</a> were before their collapse, the basic cause of which was the easy indifference of the masses of the people, their shortsighted unwillingness to get down to hard work and to make the sacrifices that an intellectually honest analysis indicated as indispensable. Do we find within ourselves any evidence of a real willingness to work and to make real sacrifices?" Koehler questioned his audience.  "The <a href="/wiki/American_Youth_Congress" title="American Youth Congress">American Youth Congress</a> inculcates an underlying mood of sullen rebellion in youth against their elders for failure to see to it, that the pleasant and easy-going conditions of these years are continued indefinitely.  It would be to rely on the mood of a lot of spoiled children to rely on the youth of today even in part, for the defense of the country. No amount of external armaments can give us safety until first we are strong internally. We need sufficient force to ensure that our help will enable the <a href="/wiki/British_fleet" class="mw-redirect" title="British fleet">British fleet</a> completely to control the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>.  Until our planned two-sea navy is ready we should accept the idea that our front lines should not be on our own doorsteps, but close enough to those of the enemy to make the <a href="/wiki/Blockade" title="Blockade">blockade</a> really effective, and now."<sup id="cite_ref-199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-199">&#91;199&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Addressing a musician's union local in January 1941, Koehler urged, "We've got to get in, the sooner the better for our defense." He warned that if <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a> where defeated, the "problem" would be left with the United States.  Calling <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Gompers" title="Samuel Gompers">Samuel Gompers</a>, founder of the <a href="/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor" title="American Federation of Labor">American Federation of Labor</a> "one of the greatest leaders of this country", Koehler spoke of the importance of music in life.<sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">&#91;200&#93;</a></sup>
In one of his last public addresses on the "International Situation", given at Newport before a group of 250 at the "Monday Night Club" in April 1941, Koehler encouraged his audience that, "We as individuals will pour out our treasures until it more than hurts, but it will be worth it."  He warned that America must make its stand clear on the <a href="/wiki/Lend-lease" class="mw-redirect" title="Lend-lease">lend-lease</a> program, referring to it as a "magnificent gesture", and saying that in the First World War, the "<a href="/wiki/Altruism" title="Altruism">altruism</a>" of the United States was "not appreciated" and was overridden by the national and economic policies and the political expedients of Europe and the East.  He called for a "definite policy this time, when the U.S. has the power to demand guarantees of future world stability."  He noted that at the end of this war, (<a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>) the world will either be <a href="/wiki/Totalitarian" class="mw-redirect" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> under Hitler or <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democratic</a> under Britain. "It is time for clear, hard, <a href="/wiki/Yankee" title="Yankee">Yankee</a> thinking," he said.  Concerning the <a href="/wiki/Balkan" class="mw-redirect" title="Balkan">Balkan</a> situation, then the key point of the conflict, Koehler concluded that the various groups were unified for mutual protection: "the <a href="/wiki/Serbs" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> are soldiers (as good as the French in World War I, since they "fight best in a forlorn cause"), the <a href="/wiki/Croats" title="Croats">Croats</a> businessmen and the <a href="/wiki/Slovenes" title="Slovenes">Slovenes</a> are the workers in the Balkans," he observed.
</p><p>Koehler accurately prophesied the Russians as "a tremendous problem because of their cross and double-cross trickery; their fear that a German invasion would conquer them; and their threat from <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> in the east."  "Russia", Koehler continued, "is terrified and subservient to Germany and professes a benevolent neutrality for Japan and <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. As to Turkey as a nation, and not the <a href="/wiki/Levantines" class="mw-redirect" title="Levantines">Levantines</a> in <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, Koehler praised their "honesty and determination of purpose". <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, he said, "is no longer worthy of discussion" and the countries that Germany had overran, "may be noisy but they cannot and will not revolt".<sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">&#91;201&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Margaretta "Maggie" Wood (Potter) (1899â1985), daughter of Rear Admiral <a href="/wiki/Spencer_S._Wood" title="Spencer S. Wood">Spencer S. Wood</a> (1861â1940), was one of the many attractive and socially prominent women that had romantic trysts with Hugo Koehler.  It would not be inaccurate to say that Koehler loved women.<sup id="cite_ref-221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-221">&#91;221&#93;</a></sup>
Maggie Potter met him in 1921 at a Washington dinner hosted by her father, the same year that Koehler met then-married Matilda and <a href="/wiki/Herbert_C._Pell" class="mw-redirect" title="Herbert C. Pell">Herbert Pell</a>.  Wood was twenty-one and Koehler a confident, worldly man of thirty-five. "I fell madly in love with him and I think that he loved me as much as I loved him," she was quoted in <i>Rescue of the Romanovs</i>.  They had a three-month affair before Koehler was detached to Warsaw as U.S. naval attache and were engaged to be married on his return; however, Koehler broke off the engagement telling her that she must "forget him".  Despite this, Potter remained friends of both Koehler and his wife, and maintained correspondence with him as a confidante until his death.  Near the end of his life, Koehler had reaffirmed his <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" class="mw-redirect" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> faith and received the <a href="/wiki/Last_rites" title="Last rites">Last rites</a>.

He was a puzzle for two reasons: his brain was vastly superior to our brains, and he simply did not fit into the American scene.  Physically he was tall, but squarely built and very strong.  When he walked, with rather short steps, he carried his head high, slightly thrown back, and he never watched his feet, as Americans invariably do. He was strikingly handsome, even in his last years, when he was not well and his hair had turned white and his waist had thickened.  He spoke English in his deeply pitched voice with a faint German accent.  He was one of the best raconteurs and conversationalists I have ever listened to, although this excellence led him to the sin of pontificating, and when there was no one well-informed enough for him to sharpen his wits against, he could be really insufferable."<sup id="cite_ref-223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-223">&#91;223&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Shortly before her death in 1985, Maggie Potter recorded her thoughts about Koehler, "As I look back, it is evident that after Hugo's resignation from the Navy, I was his confidante; he would talk and I would listen.... In his apartment in Washington, when I first knew him, there was a bookcase and its three or four shelves were filled, not with books, but with photographs of women.  I do not think they were trophies; he genuinely liked and appreciated women and never denigrated ability in a female as many men of that period did....  He said it was stupid for us in Washington to associate with only our friends, who think as we do. One should seek out the obscure midwestern congressman and find out what he thinks, what his motives are.  Of course, Hugo was right....  I think I saw him truly.  I saw him as he appeared to most people: worldly, flamboyant, out of scale with Matilda's New York and Newport <a href="/wiki/Milieu" class="mw-redirect" title="Milieu">milieu</a>; but also I saw what was behind his protective exterior, a deeply loving man, full of compassion and insight, always ready to help someone else...."<sup id="cite_ref-224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-224">&#91;224&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In 1992 a collection of Koehler's letters and dispatches to the State Department and the Office of Naval Intelligence, painstakingly researched, compiled and edited by P. J. Capelotti was published as <i>Our Man in the Crimea: Commander Hugo Koehler and the Russian Civil War.</i> The book expands upon Capelotti's earlier research and doctoral dissertation on the subject.  It represents the culmination of years of research by Capelotti, and also Koehler's extant writings and the correspondence that Maggie Wood Potter had compiled before her death. Both Potter and Capelotti took on their respective projects at the behest of Koehler's stepson, Senator Claiborne Pell.  Capelotti's anthology of Koehler's writings focuses largely on his time in Russia in the years immediately after the First World War.  Pell remained determined during and after his long political career, to explore the rumors and shadowy experiences of his step father.  Pell's efforts included communicating with the <a href="/wiki/Archdiocese" class="mw-redirect" title="Archdiocese">Archdiocese</a> of <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> in an effort to confirm the existence of an Austrian trust, that Pell believed had been terminated upon Koehler's marriage to his divorced mother; enlisting <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a> advisor <a href="/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski" title="Zbigniew Brzezinski">Zbigniew Brzezinski</a> to investigate Koehler's possible connection to the <a href="/wiki/Habsburgs" class="mw-redirect" title="Habsburgs">Habsburgs</a> and retaining an Austrian researcher.<sup id="cite_ref-225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-225">&#91;225&#93;</a></sup>

Such an individual was Hugo William Koehler- bold, adventurous, urbane, generous, and with a savoir faire that gained him ready entrance to the highest circles of international society. Something of a prophet, he foresaw the rise of Hitler's Germany, the ensurance at <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" title="Treaty of Versailles">Versailles</a> of a new world war, and <a href="/wiki/Bolshevism" class="mw-redirect" title="Bolshevism">bolshevism's</a> inevitable collapse.  In that cataclysmic time of world war and civil war, I know of no other American who so intimately associated with Russians of all levels, White and Red.  Koehler slept, ate, and galloped over the steppes like a cossack with them, week in and week out, at ease with their personal quirks and characteristics.  What those Russians are like and what they might do was revealed with stunning clarity by Commander Hugo Koehler."
